# Note_Taker

## Description

This project was created for the University of Adelaide Web Development Coding Bootcamp. This application is a note taker that uses Express.js to build the application. This note taker allows users the create notes and save them to view later. For the challenge I learnt alot about Express and implementing it into code, Along with GET and POST routes used within the code.
